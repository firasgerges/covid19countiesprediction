Functions Needed:

	ScribeDailyCovid():
		Everyday, get the new number of cases for each county and add data to covid_timeseries

	AutoRunModel():
		This might be triggered by the ScribeDailyCovid(). Once we have the latest data run the model to perform next day prediction
		Save prediction in covid_prediction with next day date
	
	GetPredictions():
		triggered by an api call to get the latest prediction for each county as json

	RunML():
		This will be called by the AutoRunModel() for each county
		It takes as argument the needed data to predict using the machine learning model
		it returns the prediction
		Input:
			density 
			education
			unemployment
			sex_ratio
			age_median
			public_commute
			infection_rate
			infection_density
			average_increase
			covid1
			covid2
			covid3
			covid4
		example: 570.74 92.6 5.3 93.7 37.8 5.867008492 0.000499665 0.285178236 21 88 127 146 152

		The machine learning model does not take county identifier as it uses the attributes to perfrom prediction.
		We Map the prediction to the county on the parent function (AutoRunModel)

		density=population/are
		infection_rate=covid4/population (rounded to nearest integer)
		indection_density=covid4/area (rounded to nearest integer)
		average increase= Average daily covid number increase = 
							(((covid2-covid1)/covid1) * 100 + ((covid3-covid2)/covid2) * 100 + ((covid4-covid3)/covid3) * 100)/3
		covid1=total number of cases from 3 days
		covid2=total number of cases from 2 days
		covid3=total number of cases from 1 days
		covid4=total number of cases today
		** so basically covid1-4 are the total cases reported by the end of each day druing the last 4 days (last 3 days + today)
